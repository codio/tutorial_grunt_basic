#Grunt Tutorial
This tutorial is designed to give a comprehensive overview of Grunt. It comes with a very simple project (a hello world type web site) and is fully runnable within Codio (or anywhere else for that matter).

##Installation if you're looking at this in GitHub
If you're reading this in GitHub, follow these steps to get started. If you are already in the Codio IDE then skip to the next section.

1. Create a free account with Codio
1. The tutorial can be found in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/codio/tutorial_grunt_basic)
1. Either a) Clone the project URL from the GitHub page (it's on the right hand side; use https if you have not [added your Codio SSH key](https://codio.com/s/docs/settings-prefs/account-settings/public-key/) to your GitHub account) - or b) you can copy the following to the clipboard : `https://github.com/codio/tutorial_grunt_basic.git`
1. From the main Codio Dashboard (where your projects are managed) click the 'Create Project' tab.
1. Select the 'Git' option, paste in the link from Step 3. then press the 'Create Project button'.
1. As soon as the project has been imported you will be taken to the IDE.

##Start up the Annotations Tutorial
Once you're in the Codio IDE, all you need do is select `Tools->Annotations Tour` from the Codio menu, then follow the instructions.

##Viewing the site
You can run the demo site in the following ways

- Open up `src/index.html` in the file tree and then right click and select 'Preview static'.
- You can do the same from the `dist` folder.
- we've also included options in the Preview menu (right most menu option); if you select 'Configure...' or you open the `.codio` file, you will see how this has been set up.

And you can run your Grunt tasks from a Terminal window

- just enter `grunt` in the console window and your Grunt build task will run.
- or look in the Run menu (second menu item from the right); if you select 'Configure...' or open the `.codio` file, you will see how this has been set up.
